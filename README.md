## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VSCode and Live Server

### Methodology

1. Start with the HTML markup for the content and provide context through semantic HTML.
2. Implement the form and function that is supported by CSS.
3. Implement application logic with JavaScript.

### Design decisions

- Use the cascade aspect of CSS mindfully.
- Use BEM-like naming convention for CSS classes targeting components to avoid unintended cascade side effects.
- Mobile(/content) first implementation
- Fluid layout -use of relative units and percentages for defining the size and positioning of elements within a websiteâ€™s layout
- Use Grid for 2 dimentional layout and flexbox for 1 dimentional layouts.
- Separate component code from page design implementation code (although all code is in a single file, components are clearly marked for reference)

### Continued development

Learn through doing - complete the challenges in order of complexity to effectively and efficiently build skill and working knowledge of frontend development.
